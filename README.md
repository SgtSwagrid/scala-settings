# scala-settings
The single source of truth for basic configuration across all of my Scala projects.
Includes `.scalafmt.conf`, `.gitignore`, IDE config, etc. 
All configuration files contained herein are automatically copied into each of my Scala projects upon modification.
This is by means of a GitHub Actions pipeline that opens a PR in each project.
This `README.md` itself, alongside the script which defines the update procedure, are excluded.
